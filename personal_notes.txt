What I learned:

-docker never used before but quite nice

-how deques work I did not know it before

-using full swag via the max rank matrix only focuses on the last K epochs,
whilst the diagonal works over all training epochs

-swag runs "independently" of the neural network training, first I thought it was integrated

What I still do not understand:
-why does it work, the math checks out but the understanding is not there
(I would not be able to come up with something like this but is nice to have in my skillset)

Remarks / Feedback:
-the workflow and learning process is very nicely structured, TODO1 leads you through the structure and TODO2 really leads you to study the paper
  and understand the workflow / process
  -also it is very possible to improve unlike other machine learning classes where you spend so much time on data cleaning and feature
  selection and model selection but you have no confidence if any of your processes really work
  -it would have been nice to know these classes are the ones you are predicting (not clearly stated)
